Algorithms used to analyse Nanopore long reads sequencing error profile.
The algorithms have been designed for Nanopore data, but can be applied for other long read data (and short read data too, however the analysis may not be relevant).

 
From raw reads and reference genomes, these scripts performs alignment and compute several analysis (low-complexity regions sequencing accuracy, GC bias, links between error rates and quality scores, and so one).

Documentation is available [here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2tYbyMkyD5PmvrQAPiRD/c/iaku8q6R3PYNhDch4IhY/). Also in the [wiki](https://github.com/cdelahaye/SeqFaiLR/wiki) but it has nicer look on the gitbook :)
